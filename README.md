# toast-notification

bit overcomplicated cos copy-pasted from my other more complex project.

it's still using the kettle-on domain.

cos android nowadays requires you to do https requests. and i have domain kettle-on, so can make certs for it.
(self-signed certs might work, but effort to get that working, when already got certbot working)
